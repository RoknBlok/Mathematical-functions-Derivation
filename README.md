# Project Title

Binary Tree, Stack, and Linked List-based Programming Project

## Description

This project is the final semester project for an object-oriented programming course. The objective is to implement a C++ algorithm with four main functionalities:

1. Evaluate a postfix expression.
2. Evaluate an infix expression.
3. Demonstrate the evaluation of a binary tree.
4. Demonstrate the derivation of a binary tree.

All the functionalities can be accessed through a command-line interface with a menu system. The project utilizes binary trees, stacks, and linked lists to achieve the desired outcomes.

## Features

The project includes the following features:

1. **Evaluate a Postfix Expression**: This functionality allows the user to enter a postfix expression and calculates its value using a binary tree and a stack.

2. **Evaluate an Infix Expression**: This functionality enables the user to input an infix expression and evaluates it using the Shunting Yard algorithm, binary trees, and stacks.

3. **Demonstrate Evaluation of a Binary Tree**: This feature demonstrates the evaluation of a binary tree by performing calculations on the nodes of the tree.

4. **Demonstrate Derivation of a Binary Tree**: This feature showcases the derivation of a binary tree by performing differentiation on the nodes of the tree.

## Usage

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.
   ```shell
   cd project-directory
   ```

3. Use the provided `makefile` to compile the program.
   ```shell
   make
   ```

4. Run the compiled executable.
   ```shell
   ./program
   ```

5. The program will display a menu with the available functionalities. Choose the desired functionality by entering the corresponding option number.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following:

- C++ compiler supporting C++11 or higher.
- GNU Make (for using the provided makefile).

## Additional Notes

- The project code is organized into multiple files, including header files and source files, to promote modularity and code reusability.
- The project utilizes object-oriented programming principles to implement the binary tree, stack, and linked list functionalities.
- Error handling and input validation are implemented to ensure robustness and prevent crashes or incorrect results.
